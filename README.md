# bluehead_methylome_bioinformatics

This repository is intended to catalog all bioinformatic work for the *Bluehead Wrasse Sex Change Genomics* Research Project. All method details, including scripts, log files, and various text files, will be included here. 

## Components of Analysis

The following categories will be included, each of which will be organised into a separate subfolder:

* RNA-seq Data QC and Expression Quantification

* RNA-seq Global Expression Analysis

* RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis

* Genome Assembly

* [Genome Scaffolding and Gapfilling](https://github.com/hughcross/bluehead_methylome_bioinformatics/tree/master/Scaffolding)

* Methylome Analysis
