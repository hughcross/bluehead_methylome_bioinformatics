# bluehead_methylome_bioinformatics

This repository is intended to catalog all bioinformatic work for the *Bluehead Wrasse Sex Change Genomics* Research Project. All method details, including scripts, log files, and various text files, will be included here. 

## Components of Analysis

The following categories will be included, each of which will be organised into a separate subfolder:

* [RNA-seq and Methylome analysis](https://github.com/hughcross/bluehead_methylome_bioinformatics/tree/master/RNA-seq%20and%20Methylome%20analysis)

    * RNA-seq Data QC and Expression Quantification

    * RNA-seq Global Expression Analysis

    * RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis
    
    * Methylome Analysis

* [Genome Assembly](https://github.com/hughcross/bluehead_methylome_bioinformatics/tree/master/Genome_Assembly)

* [Genome Scaffolding and Gapfilling](https://github.com/hughcross/bluehead_methylome_bioinformatics/tree/master/Scaffolding)

* [Genome Annotation](https://github.com/hughcross/bluehead_methylome_bioinformatics/tree/master/Annotation)
