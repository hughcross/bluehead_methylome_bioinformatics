# bluehead_methylome_bioinformatics

This repository is intended to catalog all bioinformatic work for the *Bluehead Wrasse Methylome* Research Project. All method details, including scripts, log files, and various text files, will be included here. 

## Components of Analysis

The following categories will be included, each of which will be organised into a separate subfolder:

* mRNA Transcriptome Assembly

* Differential Gene Expression

* Genome Assembly

* Genome Scaffolding and Gapfilling

* Methylome Analysis
